Thoughts, ideas and processes by Giovanni Lo Castro[^1]

Because I suffer from a bad case of Writer block, I resorted to writing my
ideas in a raw format, with the intention of iteratively refine them with time.

I call this a Repository Blog, or RepoBlog, or replog. If this becomes a thing,
you heard it here first.

Yes, I love plain text.
